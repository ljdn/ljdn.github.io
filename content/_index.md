## /work
I currently work on [Instagram video chat](https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-instagram-video-chat-and-more). My work involves writing a lot of iOS code in Objective-C and Swift, nagging my coworkers about making sure their features are accessible, and mentoring new hires during bootcamp. I joined Instagram through Facebook's [rotational engineering program](https://www.facebook.com/careers/life/facebooks-rotational-engineering-program).

Previously, I worked as a developer consultant at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/), where I wrote a lot of Java and React as well as a little bit of Kotlin (these days the extent of my Kotlin ability is remembering how to press Shift + Alt + Cmd + k in IntelliJ). I also did a lot of pairing, test driven development, client wrangling and airline / hotel loyalty points accumulating.
