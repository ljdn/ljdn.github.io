I'm Lejia. I'm currently a software engineer at Instagram :woman_technologist:. Outside of work I tutor :woman_teacher:	the wonderful students at [Ada Developer's Academy](https://adadevelopersacademy.org/). Other time sinks include practicing the violin :violin:, playing video games (poorly) :video_game:, taking my keyboard apart and putting it back together again :keyboard:, and (pre-COVID) taking circus classes :cartwheeling: / bouldering :climbing:. I (sometimes) enjoy crosswords :fountain_pen: and (always) drink too much tea :tea:.
