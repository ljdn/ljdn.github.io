I'm Lejia. I'm currently a software engineer at Instagram working on video chat. When I'm not working, I split my time between tutoring the wonderful students at [Ada Developer's Academy](https://adadevelopersacademy.org/), practicing the violin, and (pre-COVID) taking circus classes / bouldering. I enjoy crosswords and drink too much tea.
